      "The therapist's ability to remain neutral with all family members",
      "The distinction between functional and dysfunctional family patterns"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Differentiation of self is a core concept in Bowen Family Systems Theory. It refers to the degree to which a person can distinguish between their intellectual and emotional functioning and maintain a sense of self while remaining emotionally connected to others. Well-differentiated individuals can think clearly even under stress, make decisions based on principles rather than emotional reactivity, and maintain closeness without fusion or emotional cutoff.",

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Unbalancing is a Structural Family Therapy technique where the therapist deliberately supports one family member or subsystem over another to disrupt the existing family structure and create therapeutic change. This is done strategically to challenge rigid patterns and hierarchies.",

    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "First-order cybernetics operates from the assumption that the observer (therapist) is outside the system being observed and can objectively study it. This represents an earlier, more mechanistic view of systems theory. In contrast, second-order cybernetics recognizes that the observer is part of the system and influences what is observed.",

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The MRI model of Strategic therapy focuses on how attempted solutions to problems often maintain or worsen the problem. The primary therapeutic goal is to interrupt these problem-maintaining sequences by changing the behavioral patterns around the problem, rather than exploring underlying causes or restructuring family organization.",

    "explanation": "The miracle question is a signature technique in Solution-Focused Brief Therapy. It asks clients to imagine that a miracle occurred overnight and the problem is solved: 'What would be different? How would you know?' This helps clients identify concrete, observable changes they desire and creates hope by focusing on solutions rather than problems.",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This exemplifies circular questioning, developed by the Milan systemic therapy team. Circular questions ask family members to describe relationships between other family members or comment on how one person's behavior affects another. These questions reveal circular causality and recursive patterns in family interaction, moving beyond linear cause-and-effect thinking.",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Externalization is a core Narrative therapy technique where the problem is linguistically separated from the person's identity. Instead of 'I am depressed' (problem as identity), it becomes 'the depression' (problem as external entity). This reduces shame and blame while empowering the person to take action against the problem.",

    "correct": 1,

    "vignette": "A married couple seeks therapy for chronic conflict. The therapist learns that when the couple argues, the husband typically calls his mother to complain about his wife. The mother then criticizes the wife to other family members. When the wife discovers this, the marital conflict intensifies.",

      "Appropriate differentiation and boundary maintenance",
      "Multigenerational transmission of anxiety"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This illustrates triangulation, a core Bowen concept where a two-person system under stress pulls in a third person to stabilize the anxiety. The husband triangulates his mother into the marital dyad to reduce tension. However, this pattern ultimately increases overall system anxiety and prevents the couple from resolving their issues directly. Triangulation is a common way families manage anxiety but typically maintains problems rather than resolving them.",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Joining is the process by which the structural therapist accommodates to the family's style, language, and affective range to establish rapport and become part of the therapeutic system. Minuchin emphasized that without successful joining, the therapist cannot have the leverage to restructure the family. Joining involves respecting the family's organization while planning for structural change.",
