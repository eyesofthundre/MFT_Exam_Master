It refers to the degree to which a person can distinguish between their intellectual and emotional functioning and maintain a sense of self while remaining emotionally connected to others. Well-differentiated individuals can think clearly even under stress, make decisions based on principles rather than emotional reactivity, and maintain closeness without fusion or emotional cutoff.",

        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "The family projection process is a Bowen concept describing how parental undifferentiation and anxiety are transmitted to children, typically focusing intensely on one particular child. This child becomes the object of parental worry, often develops more symptoms, and achieves a lower level of differentiation. The process involves three steps: the parent focuses anxiety on a child, the parent interprets the child's behavior as confirming the worry, and the parent treats the child as if the worry is valid, which actually impairs the child's functioning.",

Here, the daughter's anxiety prevents the custody change (feared by all) and provides a way for the divorced parents to collaborate and connect around caregiving rather than conflict.

Over multiple generations, small differences in differentiation can compound, potentially leading to decreasing levels in some family lines. The process isn't deterministic\u2014individuals can work on differentiation\u2014but it explains how patterns, roles, and functioning levels often persist across generations without conscious awareness.",

        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "Bowen distinguished acute anxiety (response to real threats, time-limited, resolves when threat passes) from chronic anxiety (built into relationships over time, vague or imagined threats, no clear resolution). Chronic anxiety is transmitted through relationship systems and drives emotional reactivity, symptom development, and lower differentiation. It's not pathological but a normal feature of emotional systems that varies in intensity. Therapy helps people manage chronic anxiety differently—through increased differentiation rather than reactivity.",

          "Documenting patterns for case records"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "Actualizing transactional patterns is a Structural technique of bringing family interactions into the therapy room where they can be observed and modified in real time. Rather than having families describe patterns, the therapist creates enactments where patterns actually occur in session. This makes covert structure visible, provides opportunities for immediate intervention, and allows families to experience new patterns directly. The therapist can then manipulate space, block transactions, or redirect interactions to restructure the system.",

          "'Why do you think you can't cope with this situation?'"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "Coping questions acknowledge the difficulty while exploring how the client has managed to survive, function, or not have things get even worse: 'How have you kept going?' 'What keeps you from giving up?' These questions highlight resilience, strength, and resources even in dire situations. Clients often haven't considered their coping as an achievement. Coping questions validate suffering while building hope and identifying existing resources that can be amplified.",

        "correct": 0,
        "explanation": "Bowlby's attachment theory (foundation of EFT) identifies two key functions of secure attachment bonds: 'safe haven' (turning to the attachment figure for comfort in distress) and 'secure base' (using the security of the relationship as a foundation for exploration and autonomous functioning). EFT helps couples restore both functions—partners become both sources of comfort in difficult times and secure bases that support each other's individual growth and exploration.",

        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "This is symptom prescription (or 'scheduled worry'), a paradoxical intervention. By prescribing deliberate worry at set times, the therapist creates a therapeutic double-bind: if the client worries on schedule, anxiety becomes voluntary rather than spontaneous (gaining control); if the client can't worry on command or finds it difficult, this demonstrates the anxiety is not as overwhelming as believed. Often clients discover they can't maintain intense worry voluntarily, revealing their agency over the symptom.",

        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "The Milan team sometimes used a 'split team message' intervention where team members took different positions (one sympathetic to mother's view, another to father's) that mirrored family polarizations. This intervention: validates multiple perspectives, makes rigid either/or positions less tenable, introduces complexity, and models tolerance for difference. The split isn't random but strategically mirrors and exaggerates family conflicts in a way that makes them visible and potentially shifts them.",

        "explanation": "Narrative therapists explore what's 'absent but implicit'—the values, beliefs, hopes, and commitments that must be present for certain actions to make sense. For example, if a client stood up to mistreatment, what values about dignity or respect must be present? This scaffolding conversation builds from visible actions (landscape of action) to invisible meanings (landscape of identity), thickening preferred stories. It makes tacit values explicit and available for rich story development.",
