If confidential information emerges about one sibling that affects the other, the therapist faces ethical dilemmas about disclosure. Family dynamics between siblings could compromise objectivity.

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Client testimonials are ethically problematic: they reveal that a person is/was a therapy client (confidentiality breach), may involve subtle coercion (power imbalance), could exploit gratitude, and can't capture the complexity of therapy outcomes. Even voluntary offers should be declined. Marketing should rely on credentials, services offered, and educational content rather than client endorsements.",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Therapists have an ethical obligation to address colleague impairment that may harm clients. Steps may include: approaching the colleague with compassion, encouraging self-care or leave, reporting to supervisor or practice, and if client welfare remains at risk, reporting to the licensing board. The goal is protecting clients while showing collegial concern. Compassion for the colleague's grief doesn't eliminate duty to protect clients.",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Treating therapists face role conflicts in forensic settings: the therapeutic relationship is compromised by advocacy, confidentiality is threatened, and treating therapists lack the objectivity required for forensic opinions. Generally, treating therapists should: stick to clinical observations rather than custody opinions, explain role limitations to the court, avoid dual roles as treating and evaluating professional, and maintain therapeutic neutrality. Separate forensic evaluators are preferred.",

    "explanation": "Therapists may have personal values that differ from clients. The ethical response is self-evaluation: Can I provide competent, unbiased, affirming care? If personal beliefs would impair effectiveness or harm clients, referral is appropriate—but done respectfully without disparagement. Attempting to change sexual orientation (conversion therapy) is harmful and unethical. Therapists should develop competence with diverse populations rather than routinely refusing service.",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Electronic communication requires: informed consent about risks (interception, privacy, permanence), clear policies about what can be communicated electronically, encrypted platforms when possible, awareness that clients may not have private access to email/phone, documentation of electronic communications, and understanding that email/text may not be appropriate for crisis situations. Convenience must be balanced with confidentiality protection.",
