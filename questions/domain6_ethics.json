      "Sharing information with other treating providers for treatment purposes",
      "Sending client records to the client's attorney at the client's request",

      "Reporting suspected child abuse to Child Protective Services"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "HIPAA allows disclosure without authorization for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations (TPO), and for legally mandated reporting. However, disclosures to third parties like attorneys, family members (unless involved in treatment), or for purposes outside TPO require the client's written authorization. Sending records to an attorney, even at the client's verbal request, requires signed authorization specifying what information will be shared.",

      "Agree to see both siblings since they are separate adults",

      "See the sister only if both siblings give written consent",
      "Agree but see them at different times and keep information separate"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Seeing family members of current clients creates dual relationships and potential conflicts of interest. If confidential information emerges about one sibling that affects the other, the therapist faces ethical dilemmas about disclosure. Family dynamics between siblings could compromise objectivity. The AAMFT Code of Ethics advises avoiding dual relationships that could impair professional judgment. The appropriate response is to explain the potential complications and provide referrals to other qualified therapists.",

    "question": "The therapist should:",

      "See her individually but require her to disclose the affair in the next joint session"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The therapist clearly established a no-secrets policy during informed consent. When the wife requests to share secret information, the appropriate response is to: (1) remind her of the stated policy, (2) explain that the information would need to be brought into couple sessions, (3) help her consider how to address the affair (in individual or joint session, with or without therapist support), but (4) not force immediate disclosure or create a deadline. The therapist supports her decision-making while maintaining the stated therapeutic frame.",

    "explanation": "The AAMFT Code of Ethics requires therapists to practice within their areas of competence. This means providing only those services for which they have appropriate education, training, supervised experience, and credentials. When working with new populations or using new approaches, therapists should obtain appropriate training and supervision. This protects clients from harm and maintains professional standards.",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A subpoena is a request to testify or produce records, not a court order. The therapist should: (1) immediately contact the client to inform them, (2) seek legal consultation about asserting psychotherapist-patient privilege (which belongs to the client), (3) request the court quash the subpoena or issue a protective order if appropriate, and (4) only comply if a judge specifically orders testimony after privilege issues are addressed. Privilege laws vary by state, making legal consultation essential.",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The AAMFT Code of Ethics recognizes that in some situations (rural areas, small communities, specialized populations), some dual relationships may be unavoidable. In such cases, therapists should: (1) carefully evaluate whether they can maintain objectivity, (2) discuss potential complications with the client, (3) establish clear boundaries, (4) document the decision-making process, (5) seek consultation, and (6) monitor for problems. Simply avoiding all dual relationships may deprive underserved populations of care. The key is thoughtful evaluation and ongoing vigilance.",

    "explanation": "The AAMFT Code of Ethics requires therapists to respect diversity (including race, ethnicity, culture, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, SES) and to obtain education and training necessary to work competently with diverse populations. This doesn't mean only working with similar clients, but rather developing cultural competence, awareness of one's own biases, and willingness to adapt approaches to meet clients' cultural needs.",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "State laws and professional standards typically require clinical records to be retained for a minimum period after treatment ends (commonly 7 years for adults, longer for minors). Records serve important purposes: continuity of care if client returns, legal protection for therapist, and compliance with regulations. HIPAA requires maintaining records but doesn't specify duration; state laws and licensing boards typically do. Records should be securely stored and eventually destroyed per retention requirements.",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This represents potential client abandonment. When terminating due to therapist circumstances (relocation, leaving practice), therapists have an ethical duty to: (1) provide adequate notice (more than 2 weeks for vulnerable clients), (2) assist with transition to new provider, (3) continue treatment until transfer is complete if clinically necessary, (4) possibly arrange coverage or extended care for high-risk clients. Two weeks' notice for a family in crisis with active suicide risk is insufficient. The therapist should have planned the transition months ahead.",

    "explanation": "Informed consent for treatment of minors must be obtained from the parent or legal guardian who has legal custody and medical decision-making authority. In divorced families, this may require consent from the custodial parent or both parents depending on custody arrangements. The child's assent (agreement) should also be obtained when developmentally appropriate, but legal consent comes from the guardian. Therapists should verify custody and decision-making authority before beginning treatment.",
