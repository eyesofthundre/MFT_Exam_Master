This is particularly important during acute crisis periods. Even brief delays (securing a gun, traveling to another location) can interrupt suicidal impulses\u2014most attempts are impulsive, with <10 minutes between decision and action.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Good-faith reporters are typically protected by immunity laws from civil and criminal liability, even if the investigation doesn't confirm abuse.

    "explanation": "For minors, parental consent for hospitalization is typically required. Exceptions may exist for: life-threatening emergencies where delay is dangerous, emancipated minors, or situations covered by state-specific emergency provisions. When parents refuse needed hospitalization, consultation with legal and administrative resources may be necessary. Child protective services may be involved if parental refusal constitutes medical neglect.",

    "explanation": "Therapists have an ethical obligation to address colleague impairment that endangers clients. Steps may include: direct conversation with colleague if safe, reporting to supervisor or employer, and/or reporting to licensing board if client safety is at risk. The priority is protecting clients. Many states require reporting impaired colleagues. This is about safety, not personal judgment of the colleague.",

    "explanation": "Disaster response requires: addressing immediate practical needs (shelter, food, safety), psychological first aid (not therapy), normalizing stress reactions, community-level interventions, connecting people with resources, and identifying those needing more intensive support. Most people are resilient—not everyone needs therapy. Avoid pathologizing normal stress responses. Long-term needs emerge over time.",

Technology should not prevent adequate crisis response.",
