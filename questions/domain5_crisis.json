    "explanation": "Therapy cannot proceed effectively when a client is intoxicated: they lack capacity for informed consent, cannot fully participate, and safety may be compromised. The therapist should: calmly reschedule, not lecture, assess whether client is safe to drive (arrange safe transportation if not), document, and address substance use in future sober sessions. If intoxication is frequent, it becomes a treatment focus. In some cases, substance treatment must precede or accompany couples/family therapy. Don't allow an intoxicated person to drive\u2014this could involve legal and ethical liability.",

It involves temporarily removing or securing lethal means: firearms locked/removed, medications locked or dispensed in small quantities, ligature points secured. This is particularly important during acute crisis periods. Even brief delays (securing a gun, traveling to another location) can interrupt suicidal impulses\u2014most attempts are impulsive, with <10 minutes between decision and action.

However, NSSI still requires serious clinical attention because: it indicates severe emotional dysregulation, predicts future suicide risk (though most who self-harm don't attempt suicide), can accidentally become lethal, and often co-occurs with mental health disorders.
