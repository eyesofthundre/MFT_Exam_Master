This is particularly important during acute crisis periods. Even brief delays (securing a gun, traveling to another location) can interrupt suicidal impulses\u2014most attempts are impulsive, with <10 minutes between decision and action.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Good-faith reporters are typically protected by immunity laws from civil and criminal liability, even if the investigation doesn't confirm abuse.
