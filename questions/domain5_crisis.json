    "options": [
      "Educate the mother about appropriate discipline before taking any action",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Mental health professionals are mandated reporters in all states. When there is reasonable suspicion of child abuse, therapists must report immediately to Child Protective Services or law enforcement. Physical discipline resulting in bruises meets criteria for physical abuse. The therapist doesn't need certainty—reasonable suspicion is sufficient. Mandated reporting takes precedence over confidentiality, therapeutic relationship, and gathering more evidence (which is CPS's job). Failure to report is a legal violation.",

    "explanation": "Suicide risk assessment weighs risk factors against protective factors. This client has passive ideation (a risk factor) but no specific plan, no intent, no prior attempts, and strong protective factors (upcoming marriage, family support). Research shows prior attempts are the strongest predictor of future attempts. The presence of strong protective factors and absence of plan/intent/prior attempts suggest lower current risk. However, ongoing monitoring is warranted since ideation is present.",

    "explanation": "Under Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California and subsequent case law, therapists have a duty to protect when a client makes a credible, specific threat against an identifiable victim. This duty typically includes: (1) warning the intended victim, (2) notifying law enforcement, and (3) possibly seeking emergency psychiatric evaluation. The specificity of the threat, identification of victim, access to means (firearms), and lack of retraction create a clear duty to warn that overrides confidentiality.",

No-suicide contracts have been shown to be ineffective and provide false security. Safety plans should be collaborative, specific, and written down.",

    "explanation": "When a child makes an abuse disclosure, the therapist should: (1) remain calm and supportive, (2) believe and validate the child, (3) explain that they must report to help keep the child safe, and (4) avoid detailed questioning. Forensic interviewers are specially trained to elicit detailed information without leading or contaminating testimony. Well-intentioned but untrained questioning can inadvertently suggest answers, create confusion, or compromise the investigation.

    "explanation": "When a client poses imminent danger to self (active suicidal ideation + plan + means) and refuses voluntary hospitalization, the therapist has a duty to protect the client's life, which may require pursuing involuntary hospitalization. Most states allow emergency psychiatric holds when a person is a danger to self or others, even against their will. While respecting autonomy is important, the duty to protect life in situations of imminent danger takes precedence. Decision-making capacity is not the primary issue when someone is acutely suicidal.",

Understanding relationship dynamics and trauma work come later, after safety is addressed. Pressuring someone to leave can increase danger.",

    "explanation": "Research consistently shows that past violent behavior is the strongest predictor of future violence. While verbal threats, substance abuse, and some mental illnesses are risk factors, prior history of violence is the most powerful single predictor.

Many states have laws against sexual activity between adults (18+) and minors under a certain age, even if 'consensual.' Some states have close-in-age exemptions ('Romeo and Juliet laws').
