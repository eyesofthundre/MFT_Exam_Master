    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When treatment goals have been substantially met, appropriate termination involves: (1) acknowledging and reviewing progress, (2) discussing relapse prevention strategies, (3) processing feelings about ending, (4) affirming the family's capability, and (5) establishing that the door remains open for future contact if needed. This therapeutic termination consolidates gains and prepares the family to maintain progress independently.",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Returning to therapy after successful completion is not uncommon and should not be viewed as failure. Families face ongoing developmental challenges and life stressors. Brief returns to therapy ('booster sessions') can help families maintain long-term progress and navigate new challenges using skills learned in previous treatment. This demonstrates appropriate use of therapy as a resource. Change is nonlinear, and the therapist's perception of return as failure reflects unrealistic expectations.",

Effective rupture repair involves: noticing signs of rupture, raising it non-defensively ('I'm sensing some tension'), listening to family concerns without defensiveness, taking responsibility for therapist contribution, collaboratively problem-solving, and adjusting approach as needed. Unrepaired ruptures lead to poor outcomes and dropout; successful repair predicts positive outcomes.",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Culture significantly impacts termination: collectivist cultures may view independence differently than individualistic ones; hierarchical cultures may expect more directive closure from the 'expert'; some cultures value long-term relationships over time-limited contact; attitudes about mental health help-seeking vary; and expressing feelings about endings may be more or less comfortable. Therapists should explore cultural meaning of termination, respect cultural values about relationships and endings, and adapt termination processes accordingly rather than imposing a single model.",

The rate of improvement is negatively accelerated\u2014gains come quickly early, then plateau. However, this varies by problem severity, chronicity, and client factors.

For each goal, the therapist and client define: the expected outcome (0), better than expected outcomes (+1, +2), and worse than expected outcomes (-1, -2). This allows measurement of personally meaningful goals that may not be captured by standardized measures, while still providing quantifiable data.

Do they and others notice meaningful change? This differs from statistical significance, which asks whether change is unlikely due to chance.
