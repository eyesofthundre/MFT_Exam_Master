    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When treatment goals have been substantially met, appropriate termination involves: (1) acknowledging and reviewing progress, (2) discussing relapse prevention strategies, (3) processing feelings about ending, (4) affirming the family's capability, and (5) establishing that the door remains open for future contact if needed. This therapeutic termination consolidates gains and prepares the family to maintain progress independently.",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Returning to therapy after successful completion is not uncommon and should not be viewed as failure. Families face ongoing developmental challenges and life stressors. Brief returns to therapy ('booster sessions') can help families maintain long-term progress and navigate new challenges using skills learned in previous treatment. This demonstrates appropriate use of therapy as a resource. Change is nonlinear, and the therapist's perception of return as failure reflects unrealistic expectations.",

Effective rupture repair involves: noticing signs of rupture, raising it non-defensively ('I'm sensing some tension'), listening to family concerns without defensiveness, taking responsibility for therapist contribution, collaboratively problem-solving, and adjusting approach as needed. Unrepaired ruptures lead to poor outcomes and dropout; successful repair predicts positive outcomes.",

Therapists should explore cultural meaning of termination, respect cultural values about relationships and endings, and adapt termination processes accordingly rather than imposing a single model.",
