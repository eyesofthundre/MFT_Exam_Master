The key features distinguishing OCD are: the presence of both obsessions and compulsions, recognition that they're excessive (though this insight can vary), and the time-consuming and impairing nature of the symptoms.",

Symptoms include: intrusion (memories, flashbacks), avoidance, negative alterations in cognition/mood (detachment), and hyperarousal (hypervigilance, sleep disturbance). At 8 weeks, this exceeds the 1-month threshold. Acute Stress Disorder applies to symptoms occurring 3 days to 1 month post-trauma. The full symptom cluster (intrusion + avoidance + negative mood + arousal) indicates PTSD rather than phobia or adjustment disorder.",
