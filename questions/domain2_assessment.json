    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This client meets DSM-5-TR criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). She exhibits five symptoms (depressed mood, anhedonia, fatigue, concentration problems, worthlessness) present for three weeks. MDD requires at least five symptoms during a two-week period, with at least one being either depressed mood OR loss of interest/pleasure. The suicidal ideation increases severity. No manic episodes rules out Bipolar; duration of three weeks (not two years) rules out Persistent Depressive Disorder.",

    "explanation": "A genogram is a graphic representation of a family tree that displays detailed family structure and relationships across multiple generations (typically three). Developed and popularized by McGoldrick, Gerson, and Bowen, genograms use standardized symbols to show family composition, relationships, patterns, and significant information. They differ from ecomaps (community connections) and timelines (chronological events).",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This exemplifies contempt, one of Gottman's 'Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse' that predict relationship failure. Contempt involves treating one's partner with disrespect, mockery, ridicule, sarcasm, eye-rolling, or hostile humor. Gottman's research found contempt is the single best predictor of divorce because it communicates disgust and superiority, which are particularly corrosive to relationships.",

While current ideation with a plan, family history, and recent stressors are all important risk factors, past suicidal behavior is the most powerful predictor. This is why thorough assessment always includes questions about previous attempts.",

He demonstrates: (1) tolerance/increased use, (2) repeated unsuccessful efforts to cut down, (3) continued use despite interpersonal problems (marital conflict), and (4) impairment in major role obligations (missing work). That's 4 criteria, which indicates moderate severity (2-3 criteria = mild, 4-5 = moderate, 6+ = severe). The discrepancy between his report and his wife's observation suggests minimization.",

    "explanation": "An ecomap is an assessment tool that maps the family's connections to outside systems such as work, school, extended family, friends, healthcare, religious communities, and social services. It shows the nature and quality of these connections (supportive, stressful, or conflicted) and helps identify resources and sources of stress in the family's social ecology.

She demonstrates: (1) restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight, (2) intense fear of gaining weight, and (3) disturbance in body image (sees herself as 'fat' despite low weight).

    "explanation": "The temporal relationship between symptom onset and parental divorce is crucial for differential diagnosis. ADHD symptoms must be present before age 12 and in multiple settings, but more importantly, symptoms that emerge acutely in response to a significant stressor may indicate Adjustment Disorder or trauma-related symptoms rather than ADHD. The therapist must assess the impact of parental conflict and divorce before attributing symptoms to a neurodevelopmental disorder. Premature diagnosis and treatment could miss the actual etiology.",
