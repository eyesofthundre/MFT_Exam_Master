You agree to do this for a few sessions, but explain that, after this, you will want to see the whole family again.

        "explanation": "This captures the common ambivalence and confusing interactions in treating BPD clients - they may appear cooperative overtly while covertly resisting treatment. This reflects the splitting, push-pull dynamics, and challenging therapeutic relationships characteristic of BPD. While BPD includes difficulty controlling emotions, violent outbursts are NOT a defining treatment expectation. Flat affect is the opposite of BPD (emotions are intense). Simple cooperation is rarely the experience in BPD treatment.",
