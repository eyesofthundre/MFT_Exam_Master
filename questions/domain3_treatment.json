Asking 'When does Depression visit?' rather than 'When are you depressed?' creates linguistic space between person and problem.

    "explanation": "Positive connotation is a Milan technique that attributes positive motives or functions to symptomatic behavior within the family system. This neutralizes blame, reduces defensiveness, creates therapeutic leverage by making the symptom less attractive (who wants to sacrifice their child's education?), and illuminates systemic function. It's not excusing behavior but reframing it in relational terms that open new possibilities. The family becomes curious about patterns rather than defensive about blame.",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Resistance is viewed systemically as meaningful communication about the therapeutic relationship, family homeostasis, or fears about change rather than as client deficiency. Exploring resistance can reveal: fears about change consequences, disagreements about problems/goals, cultural mismatches, loyalty conflicts, or realistic concerns about proposed interventions. The therapist's job is to understand and address resistance rather than overcome it, often by adjusting approach, pacing, or goals to better fit the family's needs and readiness.",

The ordeal must be: harder than having the symptom, good for the person, and something the therapist can legitimately prescribe. The client is placed in a therapeutic bind: continue the symptom and do the ordeal, or give up the symptom. Often clients choose to give up the symptom. It's not punishment but a restructuring of the context that maintains the symptom.",

    "explanation": "Intensity in Structural therapy refers to increasing the impact of therapeutic messages through: repetition (making the same point multiple times), prolonging an interaction (staying with an issue), using strong affect (matching or amplifying emotional tone), or dramatic timing. The goal is to overcome family homeostatic forces and make interventions powerful enough to create structural change.

The therapeutic goal is to help partners become accessible and responsive safe havens for each other. This involves: expressing attachment needs clearly, responding with empathy and care, offering comfort during distress, and creating emotional safety. When partners reliably provide safe haven, relationship security increases and anxiety decreases.",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This is 'restraining from change,' a paradoxical Strategic intervention. By expressing concern about change, the therapist: addresses potential relapse anxiety, challenges the family to prove they can maintain change, prevents premature termination (families often leave when symptoms remit), and creates a therapeutic bind (change to prove therapist wrong, or slow down as therapist advises\u2014either serves therapy). It addresses homeostatic forces pulling families back to familiar patterns. The apparent pessimism actually consolidates progress.",

Change occurs through: enactments where the therapist intervenes in real-time interactions, boundary making, unbalancing to challenge rigid patterns, and assigning tasks that create new structural arrangements. Insight is not the goal; actual behavioral and organizational changes in sessions are the mechanism. As family structure changes, symptoms naturally resolve because they no longer fit or serve the new organization.",
