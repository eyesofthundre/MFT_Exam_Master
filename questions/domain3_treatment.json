Asking 'When does Depression visit?' rather than 'When are you depressed?' creates linguistic space between person and problem.

    "explanation": "Positive connotation is a Milan technique that attributes positive motives or functions to symptomatic behavior within the family system. This neutralizes blame, reduces defensiveness, creates therapeutic leverage by making the symptom less attractive (who wants to sacrifice their child's education?), and illuminates systemic function. It's not excusing behavior but reframing it in relational terms that open new possibilities. The family becomes curious about patterns rather than defensive about blame.",

Exploring resistance can reveal: fears about change consequences, disagreements about problems/goals, cultural mismatches, loyalty conflicts, or realistic concerns about proposed interventions. The therapist's job is to understand and address resistance rather than overcome it, often by adjusting approach, pacing, or goals to better fit the family's needs and readiness.",

The IP's symptom might be framed as protecting parents' marriage; parents' overinvolvement as loving concern.
