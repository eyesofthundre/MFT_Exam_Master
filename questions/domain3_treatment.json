    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Establishing a therapeutic alliance through joining is the essential foundation for all subsequent therapeutic work. Minuchin emphasized that without successful joining, therapy cannot progress. The therapist must connect with each family member, accommodate to the family's style, and establish trust before assessment, intervention, or structural change can be effective.",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "In Emotionally Focused Therapy, when a withdrawn partner accesses and expresses vulnerable emotions (attachment fears), this is a critical therapeutic moment. The EFT therapist's role is to slow down the process, help the client stay present with the emotion, deepen it, and eventually share it with the partner. This accessing and expressing of vulnerable attachment emotions is central to EFT's process of restructuring the emotional bond.",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Enactment is a core Structural Family Therapy technique where the therapist asks family members to interact with each other during the session rather than talking about their interactions. This allows the therapist to observe actual family patterns, structures, and sequences as they occur in real time. The therapist can then intervene directly in the interaction to facilitate change.",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Reframing offers an alternative, more positive or functional perspective on a situation or behavior. The therapist takes the problematic behavior ('defiant') and reframes it as developmentally appropriate ('establishing independence'). Effective reframing doesn't deny difficulty but offers a different lens that can shift perception and reduce blame, opening possibilities for change.",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This is a classic paradoxical intervention from Strategic therapy where the therapist prescribes or encourages the symptom. By asking the couple to intentionally schedule and control their arguments, the therapist creates a therapeutic bind: if they comply, they gain control over the arguing; if they rebel by not arguing, the problem improves. Paradoxical interventions are used when direct approaches have failed.",

    "explanation": "Scaling questions are a signature Solution-Focused Brief Therapy technique where clients rate something on a numerical scale (typically 1-10). They provide a concrete way to measure subjective experiences, track change over time, and identify small improvements. Follow-up questions explore what would move the number up one point, making goals more concrete and achievable.",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Cultural competence requires therapists to adapt their approach to respect clients' cultural values and communication styles while still providing effective therapy. When direct emotional expression conflicts with cultural norms, the therapist can respect indirect communication styles, use culturally appropriate metaphors or stories, work with cultural strengths, and address issues in ways consistent with the culture. Imposing Western therapeutic norms is culturally insensitive.",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When domestic violence has occurred, couples therapy is contraindicated until safety is established. Immediate priorities are: (1) assess current danger and create a safety plan, (2) see partners separately (joint sessions can endanger the victim through later retaliation), (3) assess lethality risk, (4) provide domestic violence resources. Couples therapy can only proceed after violence has stopped, perpetrator has engaged in treatment, and safety is established.",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Countertransference refers to the therapist's emotional reactions to clients that are influenced by the therapist's own unresolved issues, personal history, or dynamics. The therapist's recognition that her feelings are connected to her own divorce indicates awareness of countertransference. This requires self-reflection, possibly supervision or consultation, to ensure these reactions don't interfere with therapeutic effectiveness or lead to biased interventions.",

Instead of 'I am anxious' (problem as identity), the anxiety becomes 'the worry monster' (problem as external entity that can be resisted). The therapist then explores times when the child 'stood up to' the externalized problem, identifying unique outcomes where the child demonstrated agency and competence.",
