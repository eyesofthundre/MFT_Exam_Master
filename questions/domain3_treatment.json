Asking 'When does Depression visit?' rather than 'When are you depressed?' creates linguistic space between person and problem.

    "explanation": "Positive connotation is a Milan technique that attributes positive motives or functions to symptomatic behavior within the family system. This neutralizes blame, reduces defensiveness, creates therapeutic leverage by making the symptom less attractive (who wants to sacrifice their child's education?), and illuminates systemic function. It's not excusing behavior but reframing it in relational terms that open new possibilities. The family becomes curious about patterns rather than defensive about blame.",

Exploring resistance can reveal: fears about change consequences, disagreements about problems/goals, cultural mismatches, loyalty conflicts, or realistic concerns about proposed interventions.

      "options": [
        "It produced invariably positive outcomes",
        "It was given to all families regardless of their specific characteristics",
        "It remained unchanged throughout therapy",
        "It targeted invariant aspects of family structure"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The invariant prescription was given identically to all families with anorexic children, regardless of individual family differences—a departure from Milan's earlier emphasis on unique hypotheses. The prescription (parents mysteriously disappearing together without telling children) aimed to strengthen parental coalition and create appropriate boundaries across all such families. This represented a shift from customized strategic interventions to a standardized systemic intervention based on common family patterns in anorexia. The approach was later reconsidered.",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Detriangling helps individuals maintain direct, person-to-person relationships without routing anxiety through third parties. This means: staying out of others' conflicts, not allowing yourself to be drawn into conflicts between two others, and addressing issues directly with the relevant person rather than talking about them to others. Detriangling reduces anxiety transmission, increases differentiation, and builds more authentic relationships. It requires managing one's own anxiety rather than displacing it.",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Psychoeducation is evidence-based and particularly crucial for families dealing with serious mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression). It provides: information about the illness (symptoms, course, treatment), reduces blame and stigma, improves medication adherence, teaches communication and problem-solving skills, and significantly reduces relapse rates. Psychoeducation empowers families with knowledge, reduces expressed emotion, and improves outcomes. It's a standard component of family interventions for SMI.",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Gottman's 'softened startup' means beginning difficult conversations gently rather than harshly. Instead of criticism/contempt ('You never...you're so...'), use: 'I feel...' statements, specific observations, clear requests. Harsh startups predict the course of the entire conversation—91% of the time, conversations that start negatively end negatively. Soft startup includes: complaining without blaming, stating needs positively, being polite and appreciative, and not storing things up. This dramatically improves conflict outcomes.",
