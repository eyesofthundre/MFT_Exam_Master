## 🎓 Study Tips

### **For Practice Mode:**
1. Start with easy questions to build confidence
2. Focus on one domain at a time initially
3. Read all explanations, even when you get it right
4. Review citations - they're important for the real exam
5. Use spaced repetition: review missed questions later

### **For Exam Simulation:**
1. Simulate real conditions: quiet room, 6-hour timer
2. Take breaks every 50 questions (like the real exam)
3. Don't second-guess yourself too much
4. Flag questions you're unsure about for review
5. Practice time management: ~1.8 minutes per question

### **General Tips:**
- Study consistently: 30-60 minutes daily is better than cramming
- Mix up domains and difficulties
- Use the exam countdown feature to stay motivated
- Review your report card regularly to identify weak areas
- Join study groups or find an accountability partner
